# 59FPS
A totally unplayable battle-royal mocking game. It takes all the good stuff from all the popular FPS/Battle Royal games and makes them bad, and takes all the bad stuff from those games, and makes it worse. All of this stuff is then jumbled into a half baked Unity-Free-Edition game by two people who don't know what they are doing, and one who kinda does, but not really.

Tired of Pub-fee, Forknife, Call of Shooty, Etc. Do you want to go back to the good old days of FPS battles, tons of content, cool maps, original gameplay styles, etc? Well 59FPS is a game that has:

none of those things...

ENJOY!

DISCALMER: This game is supposed to be comical, don't take it to seriously. Actually, do. I want to see your confused reaction on YouTube.

(Please fix this peter)

Release info:
This is currently a Windows-only game. Other platforms will be added if they are wanted... and if we feel like it. This game is currently on the DevBuild stage. A beta version of the game should be finished by the end of the year. With a full release sometime in summer of 2019. (if  not sooner)

Bio:
I have been programming since I was nine in languages like Python, Javascript, Java, and now C#! I love to read, (try to) draw, and build crazy robots, and puppets, and puppet robots, and don't forget, robot puppets.
Contributions:
I started this game with a friend who is no longer developing, but watching development of the game. I devote most of my free time to it now. I created all the original scripts and networking, with help from YouTube, Stack Overflow, and random Unity articles. All DevBuilds 1-6 were created by myself, and all the original graphics, most of which have been replaced now. (because they sucked) (xD)

P***r (add your stuff here)

S**f (add your stuff here)
